## Characterizing and simulating the movement of late instar gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) to evaluate the effectiveness of regulatory practices

This is the first project I worked on as a Master's student in Entomology at the University of Minnesota. I cut my teeth in R on this project and you can certainly tell that in the code. Both in terms of how I organized my data, scripts, and code and how I was programming at the time. When I first started on this project, I had not done anything in R before. By the time I was done with the project, I was much more proficient with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizing. In these scripts you'll find code for:

- Cleaning movement data recorded in polar coordinates and deriving associated variables
- Exploratory data visualiztion, which I used to get a feel for my data
- Statistical tests including ANOVA and generalized linear models, along with statistical techniques used with circular data
- A Monte Carlo simulation using parameters derived from my experiments to simulate the movement of gypsy moth caterpillars
- Publication quality plots of the results I presented in my thesis (in the process of publishing these chapters)
